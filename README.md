## Design Concept

A capybara that can't control its farting, bouncing around the map.

## Game Mechanics

Pufferfish as the protagonist: Players control the pufferfish, which can roll and bounce in unique ways, providing a dynamic and humorous gameplay experience.

Unique Movement Mechanics: The movement of the dolphin is influenced by physics-based mechanics, focusing on non-traditional methods such as rolling and bouncing.

Interactive environments: Players can interact with a variety of in-game elements such as crocodiles, pelicans and different types of terrain such as bushes and through-trees.
